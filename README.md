# number_guessing_game

Implemented a carnaval style number guessing game with Python where the player guesses a number and spins a wheel that generates a random number. If both numbers match, then the players gets points added to their score. If not, then the player loses a point. In order to win, the player's final socre must be greater than 0 (the player gets 10 guesses/spins).
